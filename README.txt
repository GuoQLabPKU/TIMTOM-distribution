1. Scripts description
    anglesTIMToTOM.py: generate relative Euler angles of TIM relative to TOM
    rotate001vect.m: rotate the vector [0,0,1] according to the relative Euler angles of TIM relative to TOM 
    showLandscape.py: show the lanscape of TIM relative to TOM
2. System requirements
    dependencies:NEMO-TOC[1] and  TOM toolbox [2]
    operating systems: Any platform (linux/windows/macos) was tested
3. Demo and Instructions for use
    First, download all the required scripts and data, then run the `anglesTIMToTOM.py` script. This will generate the relative Euler angles of TIM with respect to TOM, saved as `allResAngleRELION.csv`.  
    Next, execute the `rotated001vect.m` script. This will produce the coordinates of the vector `[0, 0, 1]` after being rotated by the relative Euler angles, and save the results in `rot001vector_coord.txt`.  
    Finally, use the `showLandscape.py` script to visualize the landscape of TIM relative to TOM. The generated scatter plot will be saved as `scatter.png`.
